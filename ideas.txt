[SUGGEST IDEA FUNCTIONAlITY]
If you reach an unprogrammed number it should still say the message and have a button to suggest ideas for that specific number. 

It should open a MODAL with a form and the number. 
You should be able to change the number to something else so you dont have to click until eternity to reach the number 
if you have an idea for example for 2024. 

-If you change the number an error message should appear. Saying: 
"You changed the original number ({count})! Are you sure you want to write a suggestion for this number?" - OR SOMETHING LIKE THIS 

i also have to declare a state and use a useEffect hook 

const [isDisabled,setIsDisabled] = useState(true)

So i need two variables 
let start = 0; 
let end = 2;

function isReached(){
     if(start >= count || end >= count){
        setIsDisabled(true)
    }else{
        setIsDisabled(false)
    }
}

useEffect(){()=>{
    isReached()
},count}

DONE!! -------------
